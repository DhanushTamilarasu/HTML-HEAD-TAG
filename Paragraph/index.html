            The p tag in HTML defines a paragraph. 

            These have both opening and closing tags.

            So anything mentioned within p and /p is treated as a paragraph.

            A paragraph is a block-level element so a new paragraph always begins on a new line, 

            and browsers naturally put some space before and after a paragraph to make it look neat and easy to read.</pre>

            The HTML pre tag defines preformatted text.
            It displays text in a fixed-width font and preserves spaces and line breaks.
            The text is displayed exactly as it is written in the HTML source code
        </pre>
        <pre>
            The "pre" tag has a WIDTH attribute that specifies the maximum number of characters that will appear on a line. 
            This allows the presentation system to select a suitable font and indentation.

            The "p" and br tags are HTML tags that add breaks to text to make it easier to read. <br>
            The "p" tag is a block level element that adds content and changes paragraphs. <br>
            The "br" tag forces a line break within the element.<br>
